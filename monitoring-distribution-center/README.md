# Amazon Monitoring Distribution Center - Capstone Project

This repo you will find the following use-case, predict the number of items in a bin. The business problem that we are going train to address is to get the number of items in a bin and helping to manage inventory and orders

## Project Set Up and Installation

Environments:

* Development: Amazon SageMaker studio
* Data storage: Amazon S3
* Deployment: Amazon SageMaker training jobs and endpoints

the workflow is:

* imports and parameters
* data preparation
* hyper parameter optimization
* model training
* deployment
* testing

model develpement framework

* pytorch

## Dataset

The data is provided by Amazon and can be found in the following link: https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-bin-imagery/
